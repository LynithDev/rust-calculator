# Rust Calculator
First Rust project of mine to learn the language. It's meant to be a calculator that can do basic math operations as well as some other things.

## Usage
```bash
$ ./calculator <expression>
```
To go into a REPL mode, just run the program without any arguments.
```
$ ./calculator
``` 

## TODO
- [x] Add basic math operations (+, -, *, /, %)
- [x] Be able to parse negative numbers at the beginning of the expression
- [ ] Parantheses and order of operations (Parantheses -> Exponents -> Multiplication/Division -> Addition/Subtraction)
- [ ] Add constants (pi, e, etc.)
- [ ] Add math functions (sin, cos, tan, log, ln, sqrt, etc.)
- [ ] What else?
